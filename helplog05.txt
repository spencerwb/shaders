My Gaussian Blur function kind of shifts all of the pixels within the image
toward the upper-left corner. Is this ok?


Are you always supposed to add the current fragment color to the current
fragment in the bloom effect?

How do I get the Matrix post processer to stay in the gui even after you turn
off shadow builds
